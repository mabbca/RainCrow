        <h3>Weather Data</h3>
        <p>All weather data is provided by the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">OpenWeather API.</a></p>
        <p>There are limitations to the accuracy of any weather API. If you are gathering weather data for a location that is near a weather station it should work just fine. If the location is a remote area with unique microclimate (deep canyons, mountain peaks, open ocean etc.) results from the nearest weather station will not be <em>as</em> accurate. Use at your own discretion!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>The options menu allows you to select the weather data you want to include. Some data will be more or less useful depending on the location.</p>
        <p><strong>Weather Icons</strong> includes HTML to embed OpenWeather icons in your eBird checklist comments.</p>
        <p><strong>Include Link</strong> includes a link to let people know where you got this super cool weather data.</p>
